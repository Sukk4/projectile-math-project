# projectile-math-project
2014 math project that shows projectiles trajectory and some information of the trajectory. 

Projectile info: 
  speed, 
  air resistance, 
  gravity, 
  kinetic energy,
  time it took to reach 0 altitude,
  average speed 

You can change air density, caliper, mass, gravity, starting speed, starting position(x,y), angle and drag coefficient.

I made this for math class I took.

App is in finnish and the code is super messy as I built it on top of 2d-platformer-game ( https://github.com/Sukk4/2D-platformer-game )
